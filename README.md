C# app that generates CAH cards based on text file list

"What was Hannah's "14th" reason why?"
- Ron Swansons mustache
- Heterosexuality.
- A bed that smells like urine.
- HIV positive rape baby.

None of these exist, yet, in any current edition of CAH... but, alas! Now is the time to make it happen! 

A simple C# Console application that builds & outputs all the White & Black cards you want!
